# PacMan
Week 4 PacMan Assignment MIT  full-stack certificate

Installation: I used Visual Studio Code to code it and put it together then simply uploaded the files to GitHub. 

Usage: To practive using JavaScript and learn from doing. Not much you can do with it now but watch it chomp across the screen.

Support: N/A

Roadmap: It took me a while to figure out why the images were not showing up. As usual it was a simple mistake, I did not direct the image source to the folder with the images but instead had it pointed at just one image. I have fixed this issue. I would like to continue learning to code a full game of PacMan in the future.
